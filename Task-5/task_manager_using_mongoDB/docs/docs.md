# Task Manager API Documentation

## Introduction

This API allows you to manage tasks with operations such as adding, retrieving, updating, and removing tasks. The data is stored in a MongoDB database.

### Configuration and Connection to MongoDB

Before using the API, ensure that MongoDB is properly configured and connected. Follow these steps:

1. **Install MongoDB**: If you haven't installed MongoDB, follow the installation instructions from the [MongoDB official documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).

2. **Start MongoDB Server**: Ensure that the MongoDB server is running. You can start it by executing `mongod` in your terminal or command prompt.

3. **Configure MongoDB Connection**:
   - In your Go application, set up the MongoDB client connection. Use the `mongo-driver` package to connect to your MongoDB server. Here's a sample connection setup in Go:

4. **Set Up MongoDB Collections**: Create a collection named `tasks` in your MongoDB database to store tasks.
